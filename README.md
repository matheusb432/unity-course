'Unity Bootcamp: 3D Game Development' course code and notes

## Notes in Code

- To visualize notes right next to their example implementations that are scattered throughout this repository, I'd recommend using the VS Code extension `Todo Tree`, and then just filter for any comment with a `NOTE` prefix to it.

  - e.g. `// NOTE This contains a note`

- You can also just search for `NOTE` (case sensitive and with one whitespace afterwards) in the IDE of your choice and it should show every note in the project.
